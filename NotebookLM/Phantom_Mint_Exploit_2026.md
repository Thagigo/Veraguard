# Phantom Mint Exploit — VeraGuard Brain Entry
**Classification:** CRITICAL  
**Discovery Date:** 2026-02-22  
**Status:** Confirmed / Brain-Injected

## Technical Description

Phantom Mint uses a hidden `delegatecall` in the constructor to bypass traditional mint limits.

When the contract is deployed, a secondary logic contract is invoked via `delegatecall` before the constructor body completes. This allows the attacker to:

1. Pre-mint an unbounded supply of tokens **before** the `totalSupply` cap is enforced.
2. The `delegatecall` target is a hard-coded address stored in immutable storage — making it invisible to standard bytecode scanners.
3. Post-deployment, the contract *appears* compliant — `totalSupply()` returns the correct cap — but attacker wallets already hold ghost tokens minted in the pre-constructor phase.

## Exploit Signature Keywords
- `delegatecall` in constructor
- Immutable proxy target
- Pre-cap minting
- Ghost token supply

## Heuristic Pattern (Zero-Credit Filter)
`phantom_mint` → Auto-injected into Scout Brain filters on detection.

## Instruction to Brain
Analyze this pattern. Flag any contract where constructor bytecode contains a `delegatecall` opcode (`0xf4`) before the `STOP` (`0x00`) instruction.
