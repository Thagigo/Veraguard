## 🤖 The "Ghost Agent" System
VeraGuard runs a headless "Ghost Agent" that monitors the mempool and your personal audit trail.
- **Telegram Bot**: `@VeraVerifyBot`
- **Support Command**: `/explain <contract_address>`

## 🏛️ The Treasury (Live)
Transparent accounting of where your credit fees go.

## 🔐 The Vault (Your Data)
All audits are cryptographically signed and stored in your private 'NotebookLM' Folder (`The_Vault`).
You can verify any report's integrity by checking the `report_hash` against the `VeraAnchor` contract.

## ❓ Common Questions

### How do I link my Telegram?
1. Go to Dashboard.
2. Click "Link Telegram".
3. Send the OTP to the bot: `/link <OTP>`.

### What happens if the AI is wrong?
If a "Certified Safe" contract is exploited, the **Security Vault** pays out the coverage claim to affected users (Requires Vera-Pass Premium).

### Can I export my data?
Yes. All your certificates are JSON files in `NotebookLM/The_Vault`. You own them.


## Q: What is the 'Recursive Reentrancy' vulnerability?
