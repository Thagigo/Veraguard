# VeraGuard Project Rules

1. **Documentation Updates**: 
   - After every implementation is completed, you MUST update `STATUS.md` to reflect the changes.
   - Entries should include the date and a brief description of the feature or fix.

2. **Security First**:
   - All financial logic must be verified with `core/security_audit.py` or equivalent before deployment.
   - Double-spend protection and input sanitization are mandatory.

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Use `npm run build` to verify frontend changes.
   - Ensure Python backend code is lint-free (check imports).
