# MANIFESTO.md (The Manifesto of Intent)

## Source of Truth

**Security:**
100% Bytecode Fingerprinting accuracy; zero false positives from text-spoofing.

**Intelligence:**
100% Grounding in Cloud NotebookLM; the Brain must see all 42+ historical exploits.

**UX/UI:**
A 'Zenith Cockpit' where Audits and Credits are the primary focus; War Room is a tactical sidebar.

**Stability:**
0% 'Invalid Date' errors; 100% 'Sovereign Surgeon' health report accuracy.

## Directives
- Operations must run under the **Test-or-Die** protocol.
- No code reaches `main` without 100% test coverage.
- If a test fails, the code must be refined until it passes.
- Sub-agents (Architect, Infiltrator, UI God, and Skeptic) must work autonomously in the `dev-sandbox` and never ask for permission.
